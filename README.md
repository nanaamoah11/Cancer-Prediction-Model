# Cancer-Prediction-Model

### Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of patients developing cancer. Early detection of cancer is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can build a predictive model that analyzes various patient attributes and medical history to identify individuals at higher risk of developing cancer.


### Data Collection: 
The project utilizes a dataset containing  health-related features such as age, gender, smoking, fatigue and allergy of patients.
### Data Preprocessing: 
The training dataset underwent resampling techniques to address class imbalance.
### Model Development: 
The project includes training and evaluating machine learning algorithms, with a focus on Random Forests, to develop a robust prediction model.
### Evaluation Metrics: 
The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robustness and reliability.
### Deployment: 
The final trained model is deployed within a Gradio interface,  allowing healthcare professionals or individuals to assess cancer risk quickly and efficiently.
